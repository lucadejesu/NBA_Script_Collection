# NBA_Script_Collection
Collection of scripts to run from the command line that give simple-yet-descriptive NBA updates 

Just for fun and can be used to quickly find stats or live game info

Ideas to implement:
1. Live game score tracker
2. Simplified stat comparisons
3. Nightly stat leaders
4. NBA Standings generator
5. Winning percentage viewer
6. Menu to display options and how to run the scripts
7. Historical NBA stats
8. Random NBA fact of the day
